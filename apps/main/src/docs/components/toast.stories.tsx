/**
 * The `toast` function let you create a toast imperatively.
 * You can call it from anywhere in your app.
 * The created toast will be rendered on top of your app, 
 * and go away after a few seconds.
 * The `toast` function expects 2 parameters:
 * 
 * - The type of the toast, which controls the icon and color of the toast.
 *   It should come from `toast.types`.
 * - The message inside the toast.
 * 
 * This makes it easy to show a toast after an event, 
 * like a successful `fetch` call.
 * You don't need to maintain any state or render any thing for the toast.

 * The Toast Pane component let you have a toast rendered in-place, declaratively.
 * This is useful when you want a permanent toast somewhere in your app.
 * A common usage is to render a toast conditionally based on a state 
 * and optionally reset that state via the `close` prop to let users close it.
 * 
 * Similar to the `toast` function, Toast Pane requires its type to be defined 
 * via the `type` prop and its message via the `children` prop.
 * If the `close` callback is defined, 
 * the toast will also have a close button which triggers that callback.
