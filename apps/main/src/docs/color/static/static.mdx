# Static Colors

Static colors are persistent across themes. They are the low-level palette
that Moai is built on top of. They ensure consistency across all parts of the
interface.

In practice, however, you usually don't need to use static colors directly.
Instead, use high-level utilities like [`text`][1], [`background`][2], and
[`border`][3] which provide dynamic colors that are changed based on the
current theme and [always accessible][4].

## Usage

Static colors are defined as [CSS variables][5] at [`root`][6]. They are
available everywhere in the app:

```css
.heading {
  color: var(--highlight-5);
}
```

Since static colors are persistent across themes, you usually want to provide
the value for each theme manually:

```css
html.light .heading {
  color: var(--highlight-6);
}
html.dark .heading {
  color: var(--highlight-4);
}
```

In fact, the [implementations][7] of `text`, `background`, and `border`
utilities are good examples of handling colors in both light and dark themes.
