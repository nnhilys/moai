# Category Colors

Category colors have no semantic meaning attached. Instead, they are used to
show relationships between elements (e.g. categorization, labelling in data
visualizations). They still conform to the AA level of [WCAG of contrast
ratios][1].

## Usage

[At the moment][2], Moai does not support using category colors directly.
Instead, category colors are used via several components that support them:

<ColorCategoryTable />

(The list is quite short at the moment. We are adding more to it!)
