# Background Color

The `background` utility contains classes that set the
[CSS `background-color`][1] property. This is the recommended way to set
background color since they automatically change based on the current theme.

```tsx
import { background } from "@moai/core";

<div className={background.weak}>Text</div>;
```

There are only 2 colors in the `background` utility at the moment:

<ColorBackground rows={[{ key: "weak" }, { key: "strong" }]} />

The `weak` value sets a light gray background on light theme and a daker
background on dark theme. It should be used for underlying backgrounds, like
the background of your app. It can also be used to separate an area, such as
the header of a table.

The `strong` value sets a white background on light theme and a lighter
background on dark theme. It should be used for elevated containers, such as
panes, toolbars or popovers.

  to better elevate contents.
